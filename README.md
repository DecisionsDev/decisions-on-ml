## Decision automation on machine learning

This repository includes sample material to show how IBM Decision Services can leverage ML predictive models.

- [docker-python-flask-sklearn-pickle](docker-python-flask-sklearn-pickle/README.md): A sample of a predictive microservice running a sklearn model to predict a default for a loan repayment through a pickle serialization

- [docker-python-flask-sklearn-joblist](docker-python-flask-sklearn-joblist/README.md): A sample of a predictive microservice running a Random Forest Classification model to predict a default for a loan repayment through a joblist serialization

- [docker-python-flask-sklearn-joblist-dynamic](docker-python-flask-sklearn-joblist-dynamic/README.md): A sample of a lightweight REST/JSON microservice to run a sklearn ML model captured as a joblib file.
