# Machine Learning model creation

This projects gathers sample code to create several ML models:
- a Logistic Regression model to predict a loan payment default.
- an SVM model to predict a loan payment default.
- a Random Forest Classification model to predict a loan payment default.
- an Iris multi-classification model.

## Build the ML microservice
```console
python build*.py
```
## Check the ML models
Models are generated under the models folder. Note
```console
List of models
```
Note that the other projects have a copy of these models in their folders. So in case you want to run these models into the other projects you should copy them into the models folder in the other projects.
